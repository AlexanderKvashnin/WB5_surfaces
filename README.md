# WB5_surfaces
Adsorption on WB5-x surfaces
Files in VASP format where the structures with different configurations of gas molecules on WB5-x surfaces are stored. 
The name of each file is 
molecule_[number_of_configuration] _ surface _ [initial/final].vasp. 
So CO_1_101_initial.vasp means that this structure for initial position of CO molecule in configuration 1 on the (101) surface of WB5-x.
Everyone can download structures, calculate the energies and compare results with our paper.
