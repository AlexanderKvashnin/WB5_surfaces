# WB5_surfaces
Adsorption on WB5-x surfaces
Files in VASP format where the structures with different configurations of gas molecules on WB5-x surfaces are stored. 
The name of each file is molecule_[number_of_configuration]_surface_[initial/final].vasp. 
Everyone can download structures, calculate the energies and compare results with our paper.
